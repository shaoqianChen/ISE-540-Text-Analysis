Files whose names have the form 

*legit*.txt are legitimate messages. 
The first number in each filename is random; 
	it was used to shuffle the messages. 

The second number was the initial identifier of the message; 
	it does not reflect the order in which the messages were received. 


To bypass privacy issues, the messages are "encoded".
